# Dev Chodavadiya – Portfolio

🚀 Live: [https://devdaclutch.github.io/Portfolio/](https://devdaclutch.github.io/Portfolio/)

This is my personal portfolio site built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks). It showcases who I am, what I’ve built, and how I think — especially as an engineering student focused on software-hardware integration, embedded systems, and motorsports data analysis.
